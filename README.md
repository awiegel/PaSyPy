**Functionality:**
* **SMT-LIB Support:** Read *.smt2* files or define your own formula in the text field.
* **Find safe and unsafe regions:** Separate the whole region of the parameter space into *safe (green)* and *unsafe (red)* regions. Select from different *splitting heuristics* to obtain optimal results.
* **Visualization:** Get a visualization for found <span style="color:green">safe (green)</span> and <span style="color:red">unsafe (red)</span> regions. Choose which parameters you want to see. 
* **Information:** Lots of different information about your computation.
* **Settings:** Several settings available.
